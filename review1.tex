\maketitle
This is one of the best bollywood movies ever made. It depicts the life of an Engineering student in India, criticises India's rude-crude education system that prepares students for a rat race rather than grooming them to become thinkers for a new world.\\
In the words of Subhash K. Jha, ``It's not that 3 Idiots is a flawless work of art. But it is a vital, inspiring and life-revising work of contemporary art with some heart imbued into every part. In a country where students are driven to suicide by their impossible curriculum, 3 Idiots provides hope. Maybe cinema can't save lives. But cinema, sure as hell, can make you feel life is worth living. 3 Idiots does just that, and much more. The director takes the definition of entertainment into directions of social comment without assuming that he knows best".\\
